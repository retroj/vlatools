** TODO option to scale the models down while reading

   :END:      

One commonly finds models which are in meters (coordsys left) but the
coordinates are all very large because they were converted from files
specified in lightyears.  We should at the very least have an option to
divide out lightyears.  Then maybe an additional scale option after that?
