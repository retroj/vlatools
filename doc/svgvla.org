Svgvla is a tool that converts a subset of SVG format to VLA.  It is
written in CHICKEN Scheme and depends on a number of eggs that can be
installed with the chicken-install tool.  For more information on CHICKEN
Scheme, see http://call-cc.org/.

* Supported elements
** svg:polygon
** svg:path

All of the straight line primitives of svg:path are supported.  The 'c'
curve command is cheated by simply drawing a straight line from source to
destination.  None of the other curve commands are supported yet.

* Command-line

Command-line invocation is done like this:

    $ svgvla [options] <svgfile>

If all goes well, the VLA output is written to stdout.

** options
*** --center

The --center option causes svgvla to center the drawing about the
coordinate system origin.
